## Thesis assembly — parallel track (front & back matter)

Front- and back-matter tasks required by the MIT thesis layout but absent
from the weekly Writer queue. **Not bound to the weekly sequence** — safe to
pick up alongside any in-flight task: they touch only `drafts/`, `wiki/`,
and the sibling `../thesis-tex/` repo, never `src/`, so they never conflict
with an Engineer task in progress.

Biography front matter is intentionally omitted (optional under MIT thesis
specs); the `\include{biography}` line has been removed from the template.

- `[x]` **T67** `H` Writer — Draft acknowledgments front matter
  _Outcome:_ Brief acknowledgments page (~half page) for the thesis front
  matter. The agent supplies structure and neutral phrasing only; specific
  names and personal thanks are left as `TODO(human)` for the author. Front
  matter is not wiki knowledge — create no wiki page; append a `log.md`
  entry only. · _Artifact:_ `drafts/front_acknowledgments.md` · _Verify:_
  file exists; every name or personal detail is either author-supplied or
  marked `TODO(human)`; content ports cleanly into
  `../thesis-tex/MIT-thesis-template/acknowledgments.tex`
- `[x]` **T68** `H` Writer — Build the biblatex `.bib` from the wiki bibliography
  _Outcome:_ Convert the consolidated annotated bibliography (`[1]`–`[18]`
  in `wiki/concepts/annotated-bibliography.md`) and the `wiki/sources/*.md`
  pages into a biblatex `.bib` file the MIT template compiles against.
  Define a stable citation-key convention (e.g. `lamport1982bgp`) and record
  the `[N]` ↔ bibkey ↔ source-page mapping so draft citations port
  deterministically. Repoint the template's `\addbibresource` at the new
  file. The `.bib` grows as later chapters cite more — this task lands the
  initial build from the 18 known entries, not the final set. · _Artifact:_
  `../thesis-tex/MIT-thesis-template/references.bib`; updated
  `\addbibresource` in `../thesis-tex/MIT-thesis-template/MIT-Thesis.tex`;
  new `wiki/concepts/citation-keys.md` holding the mapping; update
  `wiki/index.md` · _Verify:_ every `[1]`–`[18]` entry has a matching
  `.bib` record; each record is well-formed biblatex with the required
  fields for its entry type; the mapping page resolves every
  `wiki/sources/*.md` page to exactly one bibkey

## Week 1 — Foundations (reading)

- `[x]` **T1** `H` Researcher — Read introductory materials on blockchain & L1 consensus
  _Outcome:_ Notes on blockchain structure, block creation, why consensus is needed · _Artifact:_ `wiki/concepts/consensus-overview.md`
- `[x]` **T1.1** `H` Researcher — Produce missing T1 artifact `consensus-overview.md`
  _Outcome:_ Introductory page covering blockchain structure, block creation, and why consensus is needed; links outward to the S0 foundation pages (`byzantine-generals`, `fault-model`, `consensus-properties`, etc.) for deeper treatment. New authorship, not a re-do of T1. · _Artifact:_ `wiki/concepts/consensus-overview.md` + update `wiki/index.md` · _Verify:_ S9 lint H1 resolved — file exists on disk, listed under Concepts in `wiki/index.md`, and at least one inbound wikilink from an algorithm or foundation page so it isn't born an orphan
- `[x]` **T2** `H` Researcher — Study PBFT-style consensus in depth
  _Outcome:_ Notes on PBFT phases, 3f+1, view change · _Artifact:_ `wiki/algorithms/pbft.md`

  _Outcome:_ Notes on validator voting, attestation, supermajority finality, slashing · _Artifact:_ `wiki/algorithms/pos.md`
- `[x]` **T4** `M` Researcher — Study Avalanche-style probabilistic consensus
  _Outcome:_ Notes on Snowball/Snowflake, subsampled voting, convergence · _Artifact:_ `wiki/algorithms/avalanche.md`
- `[x]` **T5** `M` Researcher — Study DAG-based consensus (Narwhal/Tusk, Mysticeti)
  _Outcome:_ Notes on DAG construction, parallel proposals, ordering · _Artifact:_ `wiki/algorithms/dag-based.md`
- `[x]` **T6** `H` Researcher — Summarize each algorithm in 1–2 pages
  _Outcome:_ 4 summaries covering mechanism, guarantees, assumptions, weaknesses · _Artifact:_ collective: `wiki/algorithms/{pbft,pos,avalanche,dag-based}.md` (Mechanism / Safety / Weaknesses-to-foreground sections on each)
- `[x]` **T7** `H` Researcher — Draft initial problem statement
  _Outcome:_ 1-page statement identifying the gap · _Artifact:_ `wiki/concepts/problem-statement.md`

## Week 2 — Lit review & framing

- `[x]` **T8** `H` Researcher — Review 8–12 papers/surveys on consensus performance & security
  _Outcome:_ Annotated bibliography with contribution/method/limitations · _Artifact:_ `wiki/sources/`, `wiki/concepts/annotated-bibliography.md`
- `[x]` **T9** `H` Researcher — Identify common evaluation metrics from literature
  _Outcome:_ Metric list: latency, throughput, communication overhead, fault tolerance, finality time, fork rate · _Artifact:_ `wiki/concepts/evaluation-metrics.md`
- `[x]` **T9.1** `H` Researcher — Cross-protocol metric reconciliation
  _Outcome:_ Extend `evaluation-metrics.md` to handle the asymmetries introduced by the four-protocol scope (PBFT / Casper FFG / Snowman / Narwhal+Tusk): (i) linear-chain vs DAG output structure; (ii) per-block (PBFT, Snowman) vs per-epoch (Casper FFG) vs per-anchor-batch (Tusk) finality semantics; (iii) mempool-vs-consensus message-count split for Narwhal; (iv) Snowman parameter rescaling rule (`K`, `α_c`, `β`) at thesis-scale `n`. Defines the unified metric schema T40 will implement in code. · _Artifact:_ updated `wiki/concepts/evaluation-metrics.md`; new `wiki/concepts/metric-reconciliation.md` if needed; update `wiki/index.md` · _Verify:_ T40 CSV schema can be expressed in terms defined here; every metric in `evaluation-metrics.md` carries an explicit per-protocol definition or an explicit "not applicable" note; protocol-scope decisions captured here trace back to `[7]`/`[9]`/`[11]` in the bibliography
- `[x]` **T10** `H` Researcher — Define research questions and thesis objectives
  _Outcome:_ RQ1–RQ5 finalized, measurable scope · _Artifact:_ `wiki/concepts/research-questions.md`

- `[x]` **L-W2** `M` Linter — Wiki lint pass (end of Week 2)
  _Outcome:_ Triaged report of orphans, missing pages, contradictions, index drift · _Artifact:_ `wiki/lint/<date>_report.md`
- `[x]` **L-W2.1** `M` Researcher — Resolve stale `TODO(cite)` markers superseded by S6/S9 (M2 from L-W2)
  _Outcome:_ Three foundation pages carry `TODO(cite)` markers asking for source-page resolution that S6/S9 already completed. Replace each with the appropriate `[[sources/...]]` wikilink (or rewrite as a pointer to `[[concepts/annotated-bibliography]]`): (i) `wiki/concepts/byzantine-generals.md:36` → `[[sources/2026-04-21_lamport-shostak-pease-bgp-1982]]` ([1]); (ii) `wiki/concepts/flp-impossibility.md:38` → `[[sources/2026-04-21_flp-impossibility-1985]]` ([2]); (iii) `wiki/concepts/problem-statement.md:167` — the "once S6 lands" sentence is now factual; rewrite as a pointer to the bibliography page or delete. · _Artifact:_ updated `wiki/concepts/{byzantine-generals,flp-impossibility,problem-statement}.md` · _Verify:_ M2 in `wiki/lint/2026-05-06_report.md` resolved — zero `TODO(cite)` markers remain on the three pages; replacement wikilinks resolve on disk
- `[x]` **L-W2.2** `L` Researcher — Ingest Gilbert–Lynch 2002 CAP proof as `[18]` (L1 from L-W2)
  _Outcome:_ Add Gilbert & Lynch's 2002 formal proof of the CAP conjecture to the consolidated bibliography as new entry `[18]`; create the dedicated source page following the S6 template; replace the `TODO(cite)` on `wiki/concepts/cap-theorem.md:33` with the new `[[sources/...]]` wikilink. Sweep for any places that hard-code `[1]–[17]` as a closed range and update to `[1]–[18]`. · _Artifact:_ `wiki/sources/<date>_gilbert-lynch-cap-2002.md`, updated `wiki/concepts/{annotated-bibliography,cap-theorem}.md`, `wiki/index.md` · _Verify:_ L1 in `wiki/lint/2026-05-06_report.md` resolved — `[18]` resolves to a source page; `cap-theorem.md` cites the formal proof; bibliography upper-bound text reads `[1]–[18]`

## Week 3 — System modeling

- `[x]` **T14** `H` Engineer — Define node model (validator states, roles)
  _Outcome:_ Node class design; states (idle, proposing, voting, committed); role assignment · _Artifact:_ `wiki/concepts/node-model.md`
- `[x]` **T15** `H` Engineer — Define network model (delays, packet loss)
  _Outcome:_ Uniform/normal/exponential delay, configurable drop rate, jitter params · _Artifact:_ `wiki/concepts/network-model.md` (split: also `wiki/concepts/network-model-phases.md` per `docs/wiki-spec.md` § Page size)
- `[x]` **T16** `H` Engineer — Define message types and protocol rounds
  _Outcome:_ Catalog: Propose, Vote, Commit, Finalize, Query with fields/sizes · _Artifact:_ `wiki/concepts/message-types.md`
- `[x]` **T17** `H` Engineer — Define event-driven simulation logic
  _Outcome:_ Event scheduler design: queue, time advancement, callback registration · _Artifact:_ `wiki/concepts/simulation-design.md`
- `[x]` **T18** `H` Engineer — Define adversarial behavior categories (per-protocol)
  _Outcome:_ Adversary catalog spanning the four-protocol scope (PBFT / Casper FFG / Snowman / Narwhal+Tusk), in two layers. **(1) Four generic categories** — delayer, equivocator, non-participant, leader-disruptor — each given an explicit per-protocol semantics row or marked `N/A` with justification (leader-disruptor is `N/A` for Snowman; Snowman equivocation reduces to a weaker "lying responder" form and must be flagged as such). **(2) Protocol-specific adversaries** — at minimum: Snowman colluding sub-sampler (coordinated query responses biasing `α_c` counts); Narwhal+Tusk data-availability withholding (worker certifies header but withholds batch contents); Casper FFG slashable equivocation refinements (surround vote, double vote with explicit slashing semantics). Each entry specifies: adversary action, victim protocol(s), measurable effect on safety vs liveness, configuration knobs (% of stake/nodes affected, intensity), and the invariant to be verified by simulator instrumentation. · _Artifact:_ `wiki/concepts/adversary-model.md` + update `wiki/index.md` · _Verify:_ every generic adversary has a per-protocol semantics row or an `N/A` justification; every protocol-specific adversary traces to its source paper (`[4]` / `[7]` / `[9]` / `[11]`); T51–T53 (Week 10 adversarial experiments) can be expressed as `(adversary_id, protocol_id, intensity)` triples drawn from this catalog — exercising the 12 generic-capability pairs under §§3–5; the 6 pairs under §6 (disrupt-leader) and §7 (protocol-specific surfaces) are catalogued design space deliberately out of experimental scope (human decision 2026-05-18, see § Backlog)
- `[x]` **T19** `M` Engineer — Design experiment parameter space
  _Outcome:_ Matrix: validator counts, delay ranges, adversary fractions, timeouts, seeds · _Artifact:_ `wiki/concepts/experiment-matrix.md`
- `[x]` **T20** `H` Engineer — Produce system design diagram + pseudocode
  _Outcome:_ Architecture diagram + pseudocode for each protocol main loop · _Artifact:_ `wiki/concepts/system-design.md`

## Week 4 — Simulator skeleton

- `[x]` **T21** `H` Engineer — Implement event scheduler (SimPy or custom)
  _Outcome:_ Working scheduler passing 3+ unit tests · _Design:_ `wiki/concepts/simulation-design.md`, `wiki/concepts/simulation-design-runtime.md` · _Spec:_ `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-13-t17-scheduler-design.md` · _Artifact:_ `src/scheduler/` + `wiki/experiments/<date>_scheduler-baseline.md`
- `[x]` **T22** `H` Engineer — Implement node objects with state management
  _Outcome:_ Node class with transitions, message handling, honest/adversarial hooks · _Artifact:_ `src/nodes/`
- `[x]` **T23** `H` Engineer — Implement message passing with configurable delay
  _Outcome:_ Delivery system with delay injection and drop simulation · _Artifact:_ `src/network/`
- `[x]` **T24** `M` Engineer — Add logging for consensus events
  _Outcome:_ Structured event log — core columns `t, node_id, event_type, seq` plus an open `fields` dict — exportable to CSV (Decision A: `round` / `msg_id` have no source in the current event stream; they are `fields` keys populated by protocol code in T28+, not columns) · _Artifact:_ `src/event_log/` (renamed from `src/logging/` — Decision E: a `logging` package on `PYTHONPATH=src` shadows the stdlib module)
- `[x]` **T25** `H` Engineer — Test basic message exchange among nodes
  _Outcome:_ Integration test with 4 nodes; delay distribution matches config · _Artifact:_ `src/tests/` + experiment page
- `[x]` **T26** `H` Engineer — Set up repo scaffolding: /src, /tests, /configs, /results
  _Outcome:_ Clean structure, README, .gitignore, initial commit · _Artifact:_ repo root
- `[x]` **T27** `M` Engineer — Set up reproducibility: seed control, YAML configs
  _Outcome:_ YAML loader, seed injection; same seed → same output · _Artifact:_ `src/config/` + `wiki/concepts/reproducibility.md`
- `[x]` **L-W4** `M` Linter — Wiki lint pass (end of Week 4)
  _Outcome:_ Report on wiki health before implementation phase · _Artifact:_ `wiki/lint/<date>_report.md`
- `[x]` **L-W4.1** `M` Researcher — Catalog the Diagrams subtree and admit it as an index category (M3a + M3b from L-W4)
  _Outcome:_ Two related edits, landed together because they are the same kind of index-curation work. (i) Amend `docs/wiki-spec.md § Index structure` to add `Diagrams` to the closed category list ("Algorithms, Concepts, Sources, Experiments, Drafts" → "Algorithms, Concepts, Sources, Experiments, Drafts, Diagrams"); the subtree was introduced in W3 (T17/T18/T20) after S8 wrote the original list. (ii) Add a `## Diagrams` section to `wiki/index.md` listing all 11 on-disk pages — `diagrams/index`, `diagrams/runtime/macro`, `diagrams/protocols/{pbft,casper-ffg,snowman,narwhal-tusk}`, `diagrams/scheduler/{bootstrap,event-enqueue,event-dispatch,timer-lifecycle,constraints}` — each with a one-line summary in the same `- [[path]] — summary` style as the other categories. (iii) Add the missing `[[drafts/front_acknowledgments]]` entry under `## Drafts` (T67 artifact present on disk but uncatalogued). · _Artifact:_ updated `docs/wiki-spec.md`, `wiki/index.md` · _Verify:_ M3a and M3b in `wiki/lint/2026-05-21_report.md` resolved — every `wiki/diagrams/*.md` file on disk has exactly one index entry under `## Diagrams`; `drafts/front_acknowledgments` appears under `## Drafts`; `docs/wiki-spec.md § Index structure` category list reads six categories
- `[x]` **L-W4.2** `L` Researcher — Repoint three dead protocol-page wikilinks in `concepts/reproducibility.md` (M2 from L-W4)
  _Outcome:_ `wiki/concepts/reproducibility.md` links to three non-existent pages — `[[algorithms/casper-ffg]]`, `[[algorithms/snowman]]`, `[[algorithms/narwhal-tusk]]` — authored against a protocol-page layout the wiki does not use. The wiki organizes consensus by family page: Casper FFG lives in `wiki/algorithms/pos.md`, Snowman in `wiki/algorithms/avalanche.md`, Narwhal+Tusk in `wiki/algorithms/dag-based.md`. Repoint each link to its family page (with `#section` anchors where an exact section exists; otherwise plain page link is fine). Do not split the family pages — option (b) was explicitly rejected during L-W4 triage. · _Artifact:_ updated `wiki/concepts/reproducibility.md` · _Verify:_ M2 in `wiki/lint/2026-05-21_report.md` resolved — zero dead `[[algorithms/...]]` wikilinks remain in `reproducibility.md`; the three replacement targets each resolve to a real `wiki/algorithms/*.md` file on disk

## Week 5 — PBFT implementation

- `[x]` **T28** `H` Engineer — Implement simplified PBFT proposal logic
  _Outcome:_ Leader proposes, broadcasts pre-prepare, nodes validate · _Artifact:_ `src/pbft/`

  _Outcome:_ Common CSV: run_id, algorithm, n_validators, latency_ms, throughput, msg_count, success · _Artifact:_ `wiki/concepts/output-format.md`

## Week 8 — Baseline experiments

- `[ ]` **T41** `H` Engineer — Run baseline: vary number of validators
  _Outcome:_ Results for n=4,7,10,16,25 per algorithm; 10+ seeded runs each · _Artifact:_ `results/baseline/` + experiment page

  _Outcome:_ Report before testing phase begins · _Artifact:_ `wiki/lint/<date>_report.md`

## Week 9 — Network delay experiments

- `[ ]` **T46** `H` Engineer — Inject moderate delay (100–500ms)
  _Outcome:_ Per-algorithm latency/throughput changes · _Artifact:_ `wiki/experiments/<date>_delay-moderate.md`
- `[ ]` **T47** `H` Engineer — Inject heavy delay (1–5s) + packet loss
  _Outcome:_ Degradation under 5–20% loss; success rate measured · _Artifact:_ `wiki/experiments/<date>_delay-heavy.md`
- `[ ]` **T48** `H` Engineer — Compare latency growth and success rate across algorithms
  _Outcome:_ Comparative plot + resilience ranking table · _Artifact:_ `results/delay/`
- `[ ]` **T49** `H` Engineer — Analyze which algorithm degrades most gracefully
  _Outcome:_ 1–2 page analysis: breakpoints, which is most robust and why · _Artifact:_ `wiki/experiments/<date>_delay-analysis.md`
- `[ ]` **T50** `H` Writer — Produce delay plots and written observations in Ch. 4
  _Outcome:_ 6+ plots, 2-page observations integrated · _Artifact:_ `drafts/ch4_results.md`

## Week 10 — Adversarial experiments

- `[ ]` **T51** `H` Engineer — Simulate delayed voters (intentionally slow nodes)
  _Outcome:_ 10–30% slow nodes (2–10× normal delay); impact on finality time · _Artifact:_ experiment page
- `[ ]` **T52** `H` Engineer — Simulate non-participating validators (offline)
  _Outcome:_ 10–33% offline; success/failure boundary identified · _Artifact:_ experiment page
- `[ ]` **T53** `H` Engineer — Simulate equivocating nodes
  _Outcome:_ Conflicting votes across the four-protocol scope; per-protocol safety invariant measured (see T54); intensity sweep includes above-threshold f > 1/3 runs (at least PBFT and Casper FFG) to expose the safety cliff that the catalog documents (`wiki/concepts/adversary-model.md` §5, §7.1, §7.3) · _Artifact:_ experiment page
- `[ ]` **T54** `H` Engineer — Measure liveness and safety degradation
  _Outcome:_ Liveness = % rounds reaching consensus. Safety = four per-protocol invariants from `wiki/concepts/adversary-model.md` "Invariant checked" columns — Casper FFG: slashable stake fraction (§7.3); Snowman: empirical violation rate vs. bound `(1−α_c/K)^β` (§7.1); PBFT: view-change rate, since equivocation converts to leader rotation (§5); Narwhal+Tusk: whether a conflicting header reaches `2f+1` signatures (§5). A universal fork/inconsistency count is insufficient — PBFT and Narwhal+Tusk cannot fork below the 1/3 threshold, so a fork counter reads zero and measures nothing. · _Artifact:_ metrics spec + plots
- `[ ]` **T55** `H` Engineer — Produce adversarial comparison tables
  _Outcome:_ Summary: algorithm × adversary × metric; robustness ranking · _Artifact:_ `results/adversarial/` · _KPI checkpoint_

  _Outcome:_ `base × 2^(failures) + jitter`, calibrated to observed RTT · _Artifact:_ `src/common/timeout.py` + wiki page
- `[ ]` **T58** `M` Engineer — Compare baseline vs enhanced
  _Outcome:_ Side-by-side latency + success rate under delay/adversary · _Artifact:_ experiment page + plots
- `[ ]` **T59** `H` Writer — Summarize key findings across experiments
  _Outcome:_ Top 5–10 findings with evidence and RQ mapping · _Artifact:_ `wiki/concepts/key-findings.md`
- `[ ]` **T60** `H` Writer — Write Chapter 5 (Enhancement) and Chapter 6 (Conclusion)
  _Outcome:_ Ch5 3–4 pages; Ch6 2–3 pages summary + future work · _Artifact:_ `drafts/ch5_enhancement.md`, `drafts/ch6_conclusion.md`

## Backlog

Agents append here when they notice out-of-scope issues during a task.

- **Dashboard arithmetic.** `TASKS.md` dashboard line previously read "Not Started: 66" when the actual sum was 65 after S0–S5 and T1–T10 completions (total 81 slots across T-tasks + S-tasks + L-tasks, minus 16 completed = 65). Fixed incidentally as part of the S6 flip (now 65 Not Started, 1 In Progress). Watch for re-drift during future flips.
- **Ava Labs documentation as a non-bibliography citation** (introduced by S9 reconciliation). [[algorithms/avalanche]] uses a `[ava-docs]` marker for production-variant details (Snowman, C-Chain / P-Chain / X-Chain, production parameters `K=20, α_c≈0.8K, β≈15`, "sub-second" finality). Per the citation policy, any quantitative claim should ultimately cite a primary paper; the Ava Labs URL is currently the only available source for some production details. Priority: L — watch for Writer tasks quoting `[ava-docs]`-backed performance numbers and flag them; ideally replace with primary-paper corroboration from [9] or [10] when possible.
- **Time-bounded experiments: run-past-`t_max`-then-clip.** The scheduler's `run(t_max)` deadline is overshoot-by-one — it exits when `now >= t_max` *after* a pop (`wiki/concepts/simulation-design.md` §3 D5 / §9), stopping on the first event that reaches `t_max`, so a sibling event scheduled at exactly `t_max` but later in `(t, node_id, seq)` tie-break order can be left unprocessed. **Decision 2026-05-18 (human, reviewing T21):** any time-bounded run (T46/T47 delay experiments, and every `run()` call with a `t_max`) deliberately uses a buffer — `run(t_max = window + buffer)` — so the real measurement boundary is interior to the run and no in-window event is ever truncated; the analysis/output step then *clips* events with `t > window` so reported metrics cover exactly `[0, window]`. Two parameters to pin when the harness (T27/T41) and delay experiments (T46/T47) are designed: (1) buffer size — must exceed the maximum settling time of any in-window action (≥ max network delay; one round/timeout duration is safer); (2) boundary metric semantics — whether an outcome started in-window but completed in the buffer (e.g. a block proposed at `t<window`, committed at `t>window`) counts toward the window's metrics, since clipping alone would drop it. Record in `wiki/concepts/experiment-matrix.md` when T46/T47 are planned.
- **Scheduler heap growth under high timer churn** (noticed in the 2026-05-19 T21 code review). D4 lazy-tombstone cancellation leaves a dead heap entry per `cancel_timer`; D4's rationale bounds garbage by "cancel frequency, which is small at thesis scale." That holds for the baseline, but protocols that reset timers every round across every validator — PBFT view-change timers (T28/T29), and any adaptive-timeout work (T57) — can accumulate a large stale fraction, degrading `heappush`/`heappop` from live-set to cumulative-set size. No test currently asserts tombstones are ever shed. Priority: L. **Watch for** T28/T29/T57: if a run's `RunResult.events_tombstoned` approaches or exceeds `events_processed`, add periodic heap compaction (rebuild when `tombstone_count > len(heap)/2`). Pure optimization — correctness is unaffected.
- **e2e determinism test scope** (noticed in the 2026-05-19 T21 code review). `tests/scheduler/test_e2e.py` `test_two_runs_are_byte_identical` reuses one `LoopbackNetwork` whose broadcast iterates members in dict-insertion order, so it proves "this scenario reproduces," not "the scheduler forces a deterministic order on unordered inputs." The scheduler's own ordering guarantee *is* covered by `test_heap_orders_by_time_then_node_then_seq`. Priority: L. **When T25** (basic message-exchange integration test) is picked up, add a case that schedules a node's downstream events in a deliberately scrambled call order and asserts dispatch still follows `(t, node_id, seq)` — or soften the e2e page's determinism claim to match what the test actually shows.
- **§6 disrupt-leader and §7 protocol-specific adversaries have no experiment task** (noticed reviewing `wiki/concepts/adversary-model.md` against the Week 10 experiment matrix; sibling scope fixes for T53/T54 already folded into those task entries). T51–T53 cover delay / offline / equivocate (catalog §§3–5 only). The catalog defines 21 adversary surfaces; T51–T53 reach roughly half. Uncovered: §6 disrupt-leader (all protocols), §7.1 Snowman colluding sub-sampler, §7.2 Narwhal+Tusk data-availability withholding. Note T18's verify clause asserts "T51–T53 can be expressed as triples drawn from this catalog without gaps" — that claim appears already unmet. **Resolved 2026-05-18 (during T19):** human chose path (b) — narrow the coverage claim, add no new experiment tasks. The catalog stays at 18 valid pairs (superseding the "21 surfaces" figure above — `wiki/concepts/adversary-model.md` §1 is authoritative; the covered subset is 12, not "roughly half"); the 6 §6/§7 pairs are catalogued design space out of experimental scope. T18's verify clause, `adversary-model.md` §1 + §8, `wiki/index.md`, and `wiki/concepts/experiment-matrix.md` §8 all amended to state T51–T53 exercise 12 of 18 pairs.
- **Node event stream: `event_sink` emit-tuple shape + bare event-name strings** (noticed in the 2026-05-19 T22 code review). `Scheduler.bind` routes `Node.emit(event_type, fields, t)` into `event_sink` as the tuple `(t, node_id, EMIT_SEQ, ("emit", event_type, fields))`. That `("emit", event_type, fields)` payload shape is a cross-component seam — `Node.emit` → `Scheduler.event_sink` → T24 `src/logging/` — that no wiki page currently pins. Separately, event-type names are bare string literals (`"halted"` in `src/nodes/node.py`, `"decided"` via `_emit_decided`; protocol-specific events arrive in T28+). Priority: L. **When T24** (logging / structured event schema) is picked up: document the emit-tuple shape as part of the event schema, and consider promoting event-type names to a shared constant/enum so a rename fails fast instead of silently.
- **No public read accessor for `Node._halt_reason`** (noticed in the 2026-05-19 T22 code review). `Node.halt(reason, t)` stores `self._halt_reason` privately and surfaces it only inside the emitted `halted` event; there is no getter. `wiki/concepts/node-model.md` exposes the halt reason solely via that event, so the current state is contract-faithful. Priority: L. **Watch for T32**: if the Casper FFG FSM needs to branch on `SLASHED` vs `EXITED` post-halt without parsing the event stream, add a read-only `halt_reason` property to `Node` (and register it as a `node-model.md` Revision).
- **`Node.__init__` accepts non-finite `weight` (`NaN`, `±inf`)** (noticed in the 2026-05-20 T25 walkthrough Module 2). `Node.__init__` validates `weight < 0`, but `NaN` slips past because `float('nan') < 0` is `False`; `+inf` and `-inf` would also pass or fail unhelpfully. No protocol uses `weight` yet, so the current state is contract-faithful for T22. **Watch for T32** (Casper FFG): `weight` becomes staked balance there, and a `NaN`/`inf` weight from a malformed config would corrupt the FSM's threshold arithmetic silently rather than fail at construction. Fix at `Node.__init__`: reject any non-finite weight with `ValueError` (`math.isfinite(weight)` is the one-liner). Priority: L — pure config-hygiene; precondition for T32.
- **`Network.register` / `Scheduler.bind` / `Network.start` lack fail-fast collision-or-repeat checks; `Node.__init__` accepts `node_id = -1` (the `PhaseAdvance` sentinel)** (Network noticed in the 2026-05-19 T23 code review; symmetric scheduler-side issue noticed in the 2026-05-20 T25 walkthrough; the sentinel-collision sub-issue noticed in the same walkthrough's Module 2; `Network.start` idempotency added 2026-05-20 from the same walkthrough's Module 3). Three boundary-seam holes that should be hardened together as a single fail-fast pass: **(a)** `Network.register(node)` — `registry[node.id] = node` — performs no collision check; registering two nodes with the same `id`, or re-registering one, silently clobbers. **(b)** `Scheduler.bind(node)` — `self.nodes[node.id] = node` — has the same hole. **(c)** `Network.start()` is not idempotent — calling it twice re-runs `validate_timeline` (cheap) and re-schedules every interior `PhaseAdvance` boundary, doubling phase-rollover events on the heap; the `_started` flag is set but never checked. All three are asymmetric with the unregistered-`dst` paths in `Network._try_deliver` and `Scheduler._dispatch._node`, which both fail fast with `KeyError`. Separately, `Node.__init__` accepts any `int` as `node_id`, including `-1` — the value the scheduler reserves as the `PhaseAdvance` sentinel for the heap's `(t, node_id, seq)` tie-break (`scheduler.py`); a misconfigured Node with `id = -1` would silently sort with `PhaseAdvance` rather than after it. Fix-together rationale: fail-fast at the `Node.__init__` boundary if `node_id < 0`, at the `bind` / `register` seam if `node.id` is already present, and at `start()` if `self._started` is already true — rather than piecemeal. Priority: L. **Watch for** the T19/T27 experiment harness: when node construction and bootstrap are driven from config, a duplicate/negative `NodeId` or a double-bootstrap should fail fast rather than silently drop a validator, scramble heap ordering, or double-fire phase rollovers. Pure robustness — a well-formed run is unaffected.
- **PBFT-specific network-drop integration test** (raised during T31; human-approved deferral, 2026-05-21). T31's message-loss coverage is unit-level (`tests/pbft/test_message_loss.py`): a lost message is modelled as an `on_message` call that never happens, covering loss within the `2f+1` quorum's `f`-fault tolerance and the view-change recovery past it. End-to-end network *drop* is exercised only generically by `tests/integration/test_drop_rate.py`. A PBFT-specific integration test driving the full W3 stack under a non-zero `drop_rate` — confirming the protocol commits while loss stays within tolerance and recovers via view-change once it exceeds `f` — would de-risk the heavy-loss experiments. Priority: L. **When T47** (heavy delay + packet loss) is picked up, add it to `tests/integration/`.
- **Network e2e tests: stochastic-delay distribution check + full-`RunResult` determinism** (noticed in the 2026-05-19 T23 Task-7 code review). Two follow-ups for **T25** ("Test basic message exchange among nodes; delay distribution matches config"). **(M1)** `tests/network/test_e2e.py` now drives a stochastic (`uniform`) delay end-to-end in two determinism tests, so the RNG-driven delay-sampling path *is* exercised — but no e2e test asserts the delay *distribution shape* matches config (e.g. mean/spread over many seeded runs land within the configured `[low, high]`). T25's "delay distribution matches config" outcome is exactly that check; make sure its plan includes it, not just "a random delay was drawn." **(L1)** the e2e determinism tests compare only the captured delivery stream (`network-model-phases.md §6.4` tuple), not the full `RunResult` (`events_processed`, final `now`, `stopped_by`). Comparing `result` too would catch divergence the stream-only check misses. Priority: L — optional hardening; the delivery stream is the §6.4 contract unit, so the current check is contract-faithful.
- **No coverage tooling — fold a `make coverage` target into T26 scaffolding** (raised during the 2026-05-19 T25 review; human decision to defer rather than widen T25 scope). The repo has no coverage measurement and no dependency manifest. An ad-hoc measurement during the T25 review (stdlib `trace`) put the full suite at 99.8% line coverage of `src/` — 491/492 executable lines; the sole uncovered line is `src/scheduler/scheduler.py:179`, the unreachable defensive `raise` in `_dispatch`'s `else` (`Event` is a closed three-member union, so a coverage gate set at 100% would fail on intentionally-unreachable code). The T25 integration suite alone covers ~64%, by design — it is a cross-component build-verification test, not a coverage test. **When T26** (repo scaffolding) is picked up: add a standing `make coverage` target alongside the `make test` Makefile T25 introduced, and (i) decide the mechanism — stdlib `trace` (no dependency, line coverage only) vs `coverage.py` (branch coverage, accurate, but the repo's first external dependency, requiring the `requirements-dev.txt` / `pyproject.toml` manifest T26 should create anyway); (ii) measure **branch coverage**, not just line coverage — line coverage is already 99.8%, so untaken branches are where real test gaps would surface; (iii) decide whether the target is report-only or enforces a floor. Priority: M.
- **PBFT proposal-phase review follow-ups** (noticed in the 2026-05-21 T28 reviews). Two seams the T28 pre-prepare implementation deliberately leaves for T29/T18, plus minor polish. **(a) Payload-shape validation gap.** `PBFTNode._handle_pre_prepare` binds `pp = msg.payload` and immediately reads `pp.view` with no shape check; a `PRE-PREPARE` envelope carrying `None` or a non-`PrePreparePayload` object would raise `AttributeError` and crash `Node.on_message`, defeating the design's log-and-drop intent (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-21-t28-pbft-proposal-design.md` §7.4 — recipients must not crash on malformed input, because T18 will inject malformed PRE-PREPAREs). Unreachable in T28: only the honest primary produces `PRE-PREPARE` traffic, always with a correct payload. Priority: L. **Watch for T18 / T29:** when adversarial or cross-view messages can carry malformed payloads, add a payload-type guard at the top of `_handle_pre_prepare` that emits `pbft_rejected` (reason `malformed_payload`) instead of letting the `AttributeError` escape. **(b) Propose-side `view_changing` quiescence is unenforced.** `PBFTNode._propose` guards on `_is_primary(self.view)` but not on `self.view_changing`; a node still primary of its current view while `view_changing` is true keeps emitting `PRE-PREPARE`s that every honest recipient rejects under validation Rule 3. Dead in T28 (the view never changes; `view_changing` is never set true outside a hand-set unit test). Priority: L. **When T29** wires view-change: have `_propose` also return early (or cancel the propose timer) while `view_changing` is true, symmetric with the recipient-side Rule 3. **(c) Minor polish, none blocking:** `_reject(**fields)` is loosely typed (a mistyped field name silently lands in the event payload); `PBFTNode.__init__`'s `list(workload or [])` treats an explicit empty-list workload identically to `None`; the `pbft_rejected` event payload schema is non-uniform across emit sites (`unknown_type` carries `msg_type`, the five validation rejections carry `view`/`seq`); no test exercises a non-zero `initial_view` end-to-end; `TestScenarioB_n7` omits the no-voting-messages assertion that `TestScenarioA_n4` carries.
